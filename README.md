Hi, humans.
My name is William Young, you may call me Wale for short. I like running, table tennis and badminton. I am found of coding, espcially open source. Also, I write often, mainly specific tech issues, summaries of my work, and some thoughts. The language I am kind of good at is C/C++, and python. Ready to learn something here.
I write these here, just in order to make a commit.
